# Node to Server

This is a sample program to send data from NodeMCU to the server.
It uses custom made files, hence any server allowing FTP can run it.

## Directions

1. Flash NODEMCU.ino in NodeMCU (After making necessary changes)
2. Upload the rest of the files to server.
3. Make a data.txt file in the server.
4. Run it and watch the visualization.
